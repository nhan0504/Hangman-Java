# Reflection
The code in my previous hangman project was hard for future me to read and understand my own code, so I rewrote it and refactored my code after leraning Java.

Originally, I wanted to rewrite the game in Java. However, after seeing how messy my code was, I decided to clean it up and refactored my code. I also changed some of the ways I was handling how the game work to improve the runtime.
